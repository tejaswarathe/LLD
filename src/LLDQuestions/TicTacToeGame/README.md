# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. It demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts and serves as an example of Low-Level Design (LLD) for a turn-based game.

## Game Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with their symbols (X or O). The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all nine cells are filled without any player forming such a line, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Two-player mode (Player X vs. Player O)
- Simple console-based interface
- Automatic detection of win, loss, and draw states

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the Tic-Tac-Toe folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tejaswarathe/LLD.git
   cd LLD/LLDQuestions.TicTacToeGame
